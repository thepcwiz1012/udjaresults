# UDJA Results
A script that opens a link to any udja.app type results with octagram.

# This is a work in progress!

Disclaimer: This script is not endorsed by CSJ or any of his employees. This script is strictly for your use as their website needs work. Their new tests recently added have fucked up the results and made it harder to access types with octagram information relevant to that type.
