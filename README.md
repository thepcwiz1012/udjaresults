# UDJA Results
A script that opens a link to any udja.app type results with octagram.

# This is a work in progress!

Disclaimer: This script is not endorsed by CSJ or any of his employees. This script is strictly for your use as their website needs work. Their new tests recently added have fucked up the results and made it harder to access types with octagram information relevant to that type.

# Roadmap
- [x] Improve logic (Completed)
- [x] Add all types and octagrams (Completed)
- [ ] Add option to open up CS Joseph's linktr.ee which has links to all his content. Please note for some reason his link tree fails to link to his youtube channel so i'll have to add a seperate question asking if you want to visit his youtube channel.
